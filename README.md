## The sole purpose of this project is to learn something new, in this case, Clojure

### The focus of this project
- Learn the thought process of a functional programming language
- Learn Clojure syntax
- Integrate the project with third-party libraries
- Build a piece of a backend system with an API and non-relational database

### Today's Menu
This project integrates with a third party API called <food> and gives you recipes based on which ingredients you have in your fridge.
  
### How does it work
Add ingredients to your fridge, ask for recipes and there you go!
